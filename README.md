# Portifolio in R - MBA FIAP
This is my portifolio in R.

Contains what I learned in my Masters Business Administration (MBA) in Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning, FIAP, at SÃ£o Paulo,Brazil.

Here I uploaded an R Markdown and the HTML generated in Knit during my classes, which contains R commands, R plots, analysis in R, predictions, heatmaps, and other awesome stuff!

There are some files and one folder:
* 1 - HTML generated in Knit, which will work in any browsers (Portifolio.html);
* 2 - R Markdown with all codes and settings used to generate with Knit (Portifolio.rmd);
* 3 - File with all packages used to complete this lesson (Instalacoes.r);
* 4 - Folder called 'data', which contains .CSV, .XLSX and .RData files used in this lesson.
