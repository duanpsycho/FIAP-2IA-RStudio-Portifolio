# Portifolio in R - MBA FIAP
This is my portifolio in R of what I learned in my Masters Business Administration (MBA) in Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning at FIAP.

Here I uploaded what I learned from my classes during the course, like R commands, R plots, analysis in R, predictions, heatmaps, and etc.

There are 2 files:
* 1 - HTML generated in Knit, which will work in any browsers;
* 2 - R Markdown with all codes and settings used to generate with Knit.
